# Module 7: ArrayLists and Collections

Dynamic data structures that grow and shrink as needed. ArrayList is one of the most commonly used classes in Java.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Use ArrayList for dynamic collections
- Understand generics and type safety
- Perform common ArrayList operations
- Work with HashMap and HashSet
- Choose the right collection for each scenario

## 📚 Module Contents

### 1. ArrayList Basics
- Creating ArrayLists
- Adding and removing elements
- Accessing elements
- Iterating through ArrayLists

### 2. Generics
- Type safety with `<T>`
- Generic ArrayList declarations

### 3. Common ArrayList Operations
- Searching with contains() and indexOf()
- Sorting with Collections.sort()
- Filtering and transforming

### 4. Other Collections
- HashMap for key-value pairs
- HashSet for unique elements
- When to use which collection

## 💻 Code Examples

- **ContactList.java** - Manage contacts with ArrayList
- **TodoList.java** - Task management
- **StudentRoster.java** - Student records
- **WordFrequency.java** - HashMap usage

## 📝 Exercises

1. **Playlist** - Music playlist manager
2. **GradeBook** - Enhanced grade tracking
3. **Inventory System** - Product management

## Arrays vs ArrayList

| Feature | Array | ArrayList |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Size | Fixed | Dynamic |
| Syntax | `int[]` | `ArrayList<Integer>` |
| Performance | Faster | Slightly slower |
| Flexibility | Limited | Many methods |
